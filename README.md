# Final_Exam001
Intro to Python Programming Final Exam

## How to "run" this exam
1) First Fork this project so that you can push your solutions to your own exam.
   On the upper right hand corner of the screen, click the Fork button.
2) Once you have a forked copy of the test, you can start working on the project. I will explain how to set-up 2 kinds of ways for you to work on the test, there are many other ways, but you will have to figure out how to set those up on your own.
### Method 1 - Command line and local python version
Clone the project to your local machine:

`git clone https://github.com/AJM10565/Final_Exam001/`

Change Directory to the project folder:

`cd Final_Exam001`

Set up the python venv (virtual environment)

`bash setupExam.sh`

`cd python-virtual-environments`

`source env_test/bin/activate`

Move back to the Project folder:

`cd ..`

Install any external libraries:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

From here you can edit the .py files to fill in your solution...
I recommend using the python shell to test code snippets:

`python`

And you can use the IDLE IDE easily by typing:

`IDLE <name_of_file>.py`

Example:

`IDLE one.py`

If you want to take a break from work deactivate your python venv:

`deactivate`

If you want to reload the venv all you need to do is change your directory to the project folder again:

`cd Final_Exam001`

And then source the venv:

`cd python-virtual-environments`

`source env_test/bin/activate`

Move back to the Project folder:

`cd ..`

And your good to go!

## Instructions for Students taking the test

Your Instructor may have different values for some things, but if you're one of my classes:
1) There's no such thing as cheating on this test, use all the resources want. Stackoverflow, google, your friends, etc If you do use a source, and you want me to know about it, feel free to add inline comments with links to where your answer was inspired from. I highly reccomend a chrome extension called grepper for google chrome, that makes looking up code problems more efficient: codegrepper.com
2) You took this course because you wanted to learn to code. Think of this exam as both a testament of what you've managed to accomplish and also as a final knowledge check. Do your own best work, and be proud of it. Don't submit a solution if you don't understand how it works.
3) During our last day of class I will be asking you to explain your answers to a subset of the questions on this exam. During that one-on-one interview, you can only reference your solution, and any comments/links you choose to include in the text of your solution. If your answers to my questions about your solution fail to show that you understand the code you submitted, your final score on the exam will be adjusted.
4) You are welcome to use any of the python standard libraries in your code unless otherwise noted. Sometimes a question will let you use other libraries. In such cases the import statements will already be provided to you.
